# YOLOv4 Hyperparameter Optimization

This project aims to optimize the hyperparameters of the YOLOv4 object detection algorithm to make it run faster. The code is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, and the project can be accessed through Google Colab. This was my final year project for my BSc Computer Science degree at Queen Mary University of London.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Click on the Google Colab link to open the notebook. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aDtRCKaf6oHRmiN1mxehVjtTHilG9lVJ?usp=sharing
2. Make a copy of the notebook to your own Google Drive.
3. Run the notebook and tweak the hyperparameters as necessary to optimize the algorithm.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- OpenCV
- Darknet

These libraries are pre-installed in the Google Colab environment, so you do not need to install them manually.

## Usage

To use the project, you should follow these steps:

Link to required download:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WwDTnZWVoiUarEvQYcZSLroL4Asg2it0?usp=sharing

In order to have this notebook function you have to first download these files and add them to your google drive as this requires you to mount your google drive, for security and privacy purposes you may use the “Copy To Drive” option at the top of the Google Colab notebook to have the notebook code run independently of my account.

In your Google Drive you need to create a folder named “fyp” at the root of the drive, and within that folder create another folder called “backup”


1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Download the files here.https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WwDTnZWVoiUarEvQYcZSLroL4Asg2it0?usp=sharing
3. Add them to your Google Drive as the notebook requires mounting your Drive.
4. In your Google Drive you need to create a folder named “fyp” at the root of the drive, and within that folder create another folder called “backup”
5. Run the notebook.
6. Evaluate the results of your optimizations.
